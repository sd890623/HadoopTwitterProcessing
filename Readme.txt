Evaluation and benchmarking of fault-tolerance of Hadoop on the cloud

This program is used by Hadoop Map-reduce to tackle twitter big data processing.

Gson and hadoop-core.jar are the only two libraries my applications required for running. Please manually include them in project with IDE before running.
In my testing scenario, a runnable jar file should be exported so it can be accepted by Hadoop as map reduce task. The exported file is already contained in the folder with TwitterProcessing.jar.
The command to run this program within Hadoop is already within my report.
